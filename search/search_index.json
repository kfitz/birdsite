See you in LA for #MLA11!</p> <p> Wed Dec 30 17:07:33 +0000 2009</p> <p>Just realized I'm coming away from #MLA09 with no purchases, and no schwag! Don't quite know how that happened.</p> <p> Wed Dec 30 17:35:59 +0000 2009</p> <p>Was teased about being \"huggier than usual\" last night - must be a sign of how much I enjoyed #MLA09.</p> <p> Wed Dec 30 17:51:18 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @nowviskie, @amandafrench and @mkirschenbaum</p> <p>Indeed.

I kept being surprised to realize @amandafrench wasn't actually in Philly; connection was almost as vibrant.</p> <p> Wed Dec 30 18:34:18 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Hey, thanks for coming to the program committee session; it was really productive.  Looking forward to more innovation!</p> <p> Wed Dec 30 18:53:53 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Back atcha - looking forward to doing it again soon.</p> <p> Wed Dec 30 19:03:27 +0000 2009</p> <p>@mlaconvention: Just got off the phone with WYYY reporter; very nice conversation.

Will look forward to hearing what they pull from the conv, if anything. Lots about DH excitement at MLA.</p> <p> Wed Dec 30 19:30:13 +0000 2009</p> <p>@jcmeloni Happy birthday, and here's to greater world domination!</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 00:59:19 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @mkirschenbaum</p> <p>Sure - but I think may be less the Year DH Broke than the Year DH Got Recognized as Being at the Center of the H.</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 01:23:22 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @mkirschenbaum</p> <p>The trick now will be avoiding the calcification that such narratives of hegemony can work to produce...</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 01:24:04 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Shhhhh!</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 01:25:27 +0000 2009</p> <p>New blog post: The Legacy of David Foster Wallace http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/the-legacy-of-david-foster-wallace/</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 01:38:30 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall and @mkirschenbaum</p> <p>But on some level that would be part of the point, right? Digital scholarly communication = where it's at?</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:02:35 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>Of course, but it's no accident that the scholarly use of new social technologies is taking root first in DH and rel fields.</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:18:04 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>Which is to say it's not the same thing, but in the early stages, it's evidence of a way of working...</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:18:47 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Is all DH necessarily computational? If so, I'm not sure I'm really all that digital in my humanities. Which seems odd to me.</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:19:55 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>So is the use of Twitter not-DH/soft DH, but an argument promoting the use of Twitter hard\\(er\\) DH?</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:22:43 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>That makes perfect sense to me; I'd support that definition.</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:27:54 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Where one of those goals might, for instance, be using digital tools to improve scholarly communication...</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:29:02 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Yay! \\(Thought I was home but wanted to be sure I wasn't wrong\\.\\)</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:35:13 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall and @samplereality</p> <p>I'd say more the latter than the former - self-conscious, critical use/study of tools may be key.</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:46:43 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @jenterysayers</p> <p>There's prob a \"who has the bigger umbrella\" controversy here of the kind Jeremy mentioned in our panel... [1/2]</p> <p> Thu Dec 31 02:52:33 +0000 2009</p> <p>Replying to @jenterysayers</p> <p>...but I'd argue but DH, C&amp;C, and digital MS are all at least cognate/cousin fields...

I'm Mac, too, and w/Exchange, so using an Exch cal in iCal, which then syncs to GCal!

How is that possible?</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 03:35:39 +0000 2010</p> <p>In related news: I'm home.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 03:36:06 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @kdettmar</p> <p>Sadly, it's far more - well, not *pedestrian*, per se, but - transportational than that.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 03:37:18 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>Sooooo glad to be back here. And don't worry; the milk is a goner. As are the avocados and the unidentifiable leftovers.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 03:52:03 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @ryanhealy</p> <p>Actually, it's whole, but organic &amp; \"ultra-pasteurized.\" I don't use milk but my partner swore it lasted past the date last time.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 04:30:12 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @mattthomas</p> <p>Actually, kinda yes and kinda no. It's organic but \"ultra-pasteurized.\" My partner said it lasted past the date last time.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 04:40:54 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @pronetolaughter</p> <p>Ack! I'm so sorry to hear that. Everything of mine seems to have made it - or I haven't yet figured out it's missing.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 04:44:00 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jamescummings</p> <p>Actually, this is organic, so it's preservative-free. But the higher-temp pasteurization no doubt does it.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 15:12:57 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @brettbobley</p> <p>You know, I get how that works, and still the no-refrig milk/aseptic packaged freaks me out.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 15:15:18 +0000 2010</p> <p>It's computer hygiene day here at home: ensuring backups and software are current, cleaning old caches, fixing bad filenames, etc.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 18:47:32 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @ProfHacker</p> <p>I'll ponder. I'd agree if I'd gone at it in some smart or systematic manner, rather than stupidly backing in due to problems.</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 19:15:59 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jenterysayers</p> <p>Hello, Jentery!</p> <p> Sun Jul 18 21:35:00 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @triproftri</p> <p>Congrats - that's amazing! \\(I felt much the same after the two marathons I ran \\- took a day or so to be able to think again\\.\\)</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 00:23:42 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @wpwend42</p> <p>Cover letter for a job application? Yes, provided you have that much of substance to say. Keep it as tight as possible, though.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 15:03:16 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jbj</p> <p>Fair enough. Once I can figure out how to narrativize my stupid flailing \\(or at least what lessons I've learned from it\\) I'll schedule.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 15:04:38 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>Hmmm. Not a bad idea at all.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 15:10:58 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>Worry not.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 15:21:00 +0000 2010</p> <p>My Twitter stream is making me hungry.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 17:50:17 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>I'll be right there.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 17:57:45 +0000 2010</p> <p>I have caved, 100%: I now have MS Office on both of my machines &amp; am guiltily enjoying the non-crapped-up formatting of docs I get sent.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 17:58:24 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @academicdave</p> <p>I'd say yes, but I should probably try to keep a bit more loca- in my -vore.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:02:10 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>Excellent.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:03:04 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @academicdave</p> <p>I hear that. SoCal produce isn't bad, though...</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:06:58 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @academicdave</p> <p>Not yet - I'll be there by the end of the first week of August. Still got to pack &amp; move yet.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:12:33 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @academicdave</p> <p>Oh, but had passed through there twice in the last couple of weeks, before &amp; after DH2010, so I see how you thought that.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:13:30 +0000 2010</p> <p>Just finished reviewing proofs for an article that may not run, because I can't sign the copyright form. Curious how this will go.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:20:54 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @joncgoodwin</p> <p>Ha. No, my \"can't\" is about non-medical conditions, and not just an objection: I can't sign because I can't abide by its terms.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:46:21 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @TheRepoRat</p> <p>The latter, most definitely. Particularly in that I've already violated the terms as written. Thus \"can't\" rather than \"won't.\"</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:47:30 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @triproftri</p> <p>Can't. Wait.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 18:59:07 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @nowviskie</p> <p>What @tmcphers said.</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 21:57:41 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @nowviskie</p> <p>Man, you know how to do a vacation up *right*!</p> <p> Mon Jul 19 22:58:08 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>I am alas on something akin to that pace. Which is why it took so long for this reply to appear.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 01:15:44 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Aw, man, my undergrad library was like that - caught in transition between Dewey &amp; LOC. I'm somewhat nostalgic for it!</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 14:41:48 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @samplereality</p> <p>Spent a lot of time trying to decide whether there was rhyme or reason to the shuffle.

SO badly.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 18:55:17 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni and @dancohen</p> <p>But would that devalue links to @ProfHacker articles or links by @ProfHacker contribs?

Stress makes me literal, apparently.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 19:10:49 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>Actually, looking at the posts in my stream, a match for the string \"New at ProfHacker\" might do it; that's the most commonly RTd.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 19:12:06 +0000 2010</p> <p>Hmm. Some runaway process on the iMac had eaten up 60GB worth of disk memory. Tried to restart; machine hung. What gives?</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 19:38:00 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>*sigh*</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 19:38:32 +0000 2010</p> <p>Okay, I take it back. After restart, the 60GB of hd space is still gone. And I am puzzled.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 19:44:31 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>et al: do folks publishing in DHQ really want to use a paper analogy just for T&amp;P? There are better ways of making the arg</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 19:54:36 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @sgsinclair</p> <p>Thanks! But ugh. One culprit appears to be kernel.log, which is FILLED with errors being thrown by disk4s2. My Time Capsule?</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 20:15:05 +0000 2010</p> <p>The bad news is that I think my Time Capsule died this morning, sending &gt;23GB of error messages to kernel.log in the process.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 20:36:04 +0000 2010</p> <p>The good news is that my Time Capsule's serial number is in the range that's been mentioned for Apple replacement.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 20:39:10 +0000 2010</p> <p>Would be nice, however, if I could actually find some information about the Time Capsule replacement program from, say, Apple.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 20:49:48 +0000 2010</p> <p>Ugh; found the info. It's for faulty power supplies, not for failing hard disks. So I may be stuck.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 20:57:32 +0000 2010</p> <p>Wait: the TC mounted; whatever its problem, it's not the one throwing errors. TC=disk3s2; errors coming from disk4s2. Which is what disk?</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 21:02:09 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @captain_primate</p> <p>Since March 2008, apparently.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 21:10:21 +0000 2010</p> <p>Okay, nearly 60GB worth of logs, which popped up in about an hour, deleted. Still can't figure out which disk was throwing the errors, tho.</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 21:38:44 +0000 2010</p> <p>Hey, remember when I said I didn't want to face the next task on my list, like two hours ago? Guess what? I haven't!</p> <p> Tue Jul 20 21:44:09 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @billiehara</p> <p>WOW - that's some serious walking!</p> <p> Wed Jul 21 03:13:03 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @ryancordell</p> <p>Have you gotten ahold of a copy? I'd be happy to send you mine.</p> <p> Wed Jul 21 03:14:25 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @ryancordell</p> <p>Sure; DM me her info.</p> <p> Wed Jul 21 15:56:53 +0000 2010</p> <p>Okay, so Flipboard is pretty cool, but it sure asks for a LOT of permissions in order to interact with FB. Not sure how I feel about that...</p> <p> Wed Jul 21 23:27:13 +0000 2010</p> <p>Found out today that my passive-aggressive downstairs neighbor hired the woman who cleans my apt in an attempt to use her to spy on me.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:13:11 +0000 2010</p> <p>She refused. And of course told me the story.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:14:13 +0000 2010</p> <p>I am unbelievably tickled by this. A nice bit of information to tuck away for a rainy day.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:15:07 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>Indeed.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:17:37 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @TheRepoRat</p> <p>Alas, we both own. At least what she wanted to know was totally benign, but that she wouldn't just ask me is a scream.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:24:14 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @mmwwah</p> <p>She wanted S to turn on the sound system here to see if the bass was making her ceiling vibrate. That she wouldn't ask me is a riot.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:25:36 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @mmwwah</p> <p>But then, she did ask me about it 5 yrs ago, and we picked the subwoofer up off the floor. Now, she says, the vibration's back.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:26:20 +0000 2010</p> <p>What my neighbor wanted to know: if I'd moved my subwoofer back onto the floor, as she claims our soundsystem is making her ceiling vibrate.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:27:55 +0000 2010</p> <p>I hadn't. In fact, I picked it up at her behest 5 years ago. That she doesn't want to ask me about it directly is hysterically funny to me.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:28:58 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @brettbobley</p> <p>Oho. So this whole thing about my subwoofer is really a screen for Wiley's plan to ensure my book never sees the light of day?</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 00:37:37 +0000 2010</p> <p>Why is AT&amp;T emailing me about their new store in Niles, MI?</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 02:43:52 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @sherah1918</p> <p>Definitely begins to sound like a scam.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 03:01:21 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @unsworth</p> <p>Nice. It looked phishy, but I couldn't spot the hook. Thanks, John.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 03:10:06 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @unsworth</p> <p>It's quite clever; I could easily have fallen for it, as I have a habit of unsubbing from random stuff like that.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 03:10:53 +0000 2010</p> <p>As @unsworth points out to me, the AT&amp;T Niles, MI email is phishing; the hook is in the unsubscribe link!</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 03:12:01 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @unsworth</p> <p>I got that one, too. Is it animus toward MI, or an assumption that MI won't raise suspicions?</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 05:09:04 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @veek</p> <p>I got the Angola one overnight!</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 15:06:51 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>Woo-hoo! Need a test subject?</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 15:07:30 +0000 2010</p> <p>Two days ago I searched for a particular product on the site of a particular internet discounter. [1/2]</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 17:40:57 +0000 2010</p> <p>Since then, ads for that discounter featuring that item have popped up EVERYWHERE. Perhaps it's time to clear my caches. [2/2]</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 17:41:39 +0000 2010</p> <p>Today's massive lack of productivity is sending me out to run errands. I may even go to a movie! It's been that kind of day.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 21:55:46 +0000 2010</p> <p>Okay, now I feel productive. Got the car smogged, went to the PO, renewed my registration &amp; insurance, &amp; am now at the movies. Much better.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 23:34:18 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @jcmeloni</p> <p>Inception.</p> <p> Thu Jul 22 23:49:01 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @kdettmar</p> <p>Actually, what you want is the future anterior, my favorite tense.

I'm so sorry to hear about this - I hope the kitty's okay.</p> <p> Fri Jul 23 14:46:54 +0000 2010</p> <p>Rilly, rilly not with the program yet this morning. Or this summer, quite frankly. What say we back the calendary up a bit &amp; take a do-over?</p> <p> Fri Jul 23 14:50:39 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @JenHoward</p> <p>Gads, the things they can get into. It never fails to surprise me, either.</p> <p> Fri Jul 23 15:17:52 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>It does still happen! They're just called something like \"electronic roundtables.\" They use laptops w/large external montors.</p> <p> Fri Jul 23 15:40:54 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>Problem is no one knows what an \"electronic roundtable\" is. I wish we could decide that \"poster session\" is not a pejorative.\"</p> <p> Fri Jul 23 15:43:33 +0000 2010</p> <p>Now wondering if the energy of the DH poster session would be transferable to MLA if we were to create a specific campaign... #mla11</p> <p> Fri Jul 23 15:47:13 +0000 2010</p> <p>Replying to @briancroxall</p> <p>True.

Waaaaaaaay in the back, and pretty intimate with my neighbor. But the seat is fairly comfy and I'm hoping I can sleep.</p> <p> Sat Dec 03 22:06:10 +0000 2011</p> <p>CPH, where my Boingo account works. Even if my brain doesn't. On to Stockholm, and thence to Umea.</p> <p> Sun Dec 04 06:21:30 +0000 2011</p> <p>Have achieved Stockholm. Am more or less delirious, but have obtained currency I'm pretty sure is correct.

Not how I hoped this would end.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 01:16:34 +0000 2012</p> <p>The best part is that I get to come spend the day in the airport tomorrow waiting to see if I get on an overbooked flight off standby.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 01:21:40 +0000 2012</p> <p>Finally on the train headed back into the city. Home for about 13 hours: sleep, a little laundry, repack, and do it again.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 02:07:46 +0000 2012</p> <p>And I just realized I have no house keys. Thank goodness for the door guys.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 02:22:15 +0000 2012</p> <p>Belay that. I'm less stupid than I thought.

Hope you find some relief soon.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 04:18:12 +0000 2012</p> <p>It's a very weird thing to be transient in your own apartment.

I keep thinking of things I can grab to make the next four weeks better!</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 04:21:13 +0000 2012</p> <p>Okay, 9 am. Laundry done, mail sorted, devices recharging. A few last things to repack. Will head back to the airport early, I think.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 12:52:46 +0000 2012</p> <p>\\(Considering the starting point of the Pride parade lies directly between me &amp; Penn Station, earlier is probably better\\.\\)</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 12:53:39 +0000 2012</p> <p>Replying to @rgfeal</p> <p>Probably your best option!</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 12:56:28 +0000 2012</p> <p>Replying to @savasavasava</p> <p>So glad to hear that!</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 14:55:23 +0000 2012</p> <p>Penn Station achieved.

Here's hoping it has a happy ending. And soon.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 16:19:29 +0000 2012</p> <p>Okay, at the airport, in a line. Deja vu, man.</p> <p> Sun Jun 24 16:51:21 +0000 2012</p> <p>Processes thus far are not making me optimistic.

To wit:</p> <p> Fri Jun 27 13:48:08 +0000 2014</p> <p>Network-based knowledge carries distinction less in its means of distribution \\(imprimatur\\) than in its mode of reception \\(community\\).</p> <p> Fri Jun 27 13:48:21 +0000 2014</p> <p>Replying to @CameronNeylon</p> <p>It\u2019s exactly that modes of reception ARE modes of retransmission in the network.</p> <p> Fri Jun 27 13:54:18 +0000 2014</p> <p>Replying to @CameronNeylon</p> <p>Actually, I did mean the authority of the transmitter \\(Big Name Press/Journal\\).

What does it mean for scholarship per se?</p> <p> Fri Jun 27 15:17:49 +0000 2014</p> <p>Digital scholarship is becoming increasingly \\(though not exclusively\\) collaborative, process-oriented, iterative, and diffuse.</p> <p> Fri Jun 27 15:17:55 +0000 2014</p> <p>The digital is, or should be, everywhere in teaching.

But yes, this.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 00:59:48 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard this concern expressed a fair bit about @humcommons and have a couple of things to say. https://twitter.com/tim_hutchings/status/928907839183171589</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:19:50 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>I\u2019m going to leave aside my somewhat knee-jerk desire to point out that few have complained about the ways that projects with \u201cscience\u201d limit their address.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:19:58 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>Because there\u2019s a real point here: naming the humanities limits our reach. And to a significant extent, that\u2019s purposeful.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:05 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>The humanities have long been underserved by digital infrastructure projects. Scientists have load of open science networks. Social scientists have had SSRN.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:12 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>And as Humanities Commons began with the MLA, and MLA Commons, it seemed only natural that we should serve our own constituency first.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:20 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>But: First. Platforming outward from MLA Commons to Humanities Commons has been one step in a process. And more steps are to come.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:28 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to develop community by simply throwing open the doors. Much as I resist the Facebook analogy, it\u2019s worth considering how the platform grew.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:35 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>First, they established internally-focused networks within individual institutions, enabling members to connect with people they already knew.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:42 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>Then they created means of connecting across those networks. And only once there was a critical mass of participation did they open the doors to everyone.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:49 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>One of the mistakes that\u2019s been made repeatedly in open scholarly communication projects has been the attempt to create the bucket of everything.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:20:55 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>Sometimes that bucket has been journal-shaped, and sometimes it\u2019s been social network shaped. But they all face the same challenge:</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:21:02 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>Getting individual scholars who identify with their field or subfield and who want to speak with their colleagues to recognize themselves in \u201ceverybody.\u201d</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:21:08 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>So @humcommons has begun with communities of practice \u2014 but they\u2019re just a place to start.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:21:15 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>We welcome the involvement of new communities of practice, and we look forward to growing the network in organic, collaborative ways.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 13:21:24 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @tim_hutchings</p> <p>I completely get that \u2014 I\u2019m hoping that we can provide a bridge for such conversations very soon.</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 15:12:59 +0000 2017</p> <p>RT @winterking07: In addition to this, there's the parallel mistake of trying to implement the One Idea That Will Transform Everything Imme\u2026</p> <p> Fri Nov 10 15:14:53 +0000 2017</p> <p>Replying to @edsu</p> <p>Agreed!

Maximal inclusiveness remains an important goal.

Over the course of two highly -- *eventful* years, let's call them -- I read and thought and wrote a bunch about generosity, about the public good, and about the challenges facing today's institutions of higher education. #generousthinking</p> <p> Wed Feb 28 14:54:11 +0000 2018</p> <p>Just about two years ago, I gave a talk at the University of Richmond that I thought might turn out to be the first chunk of a new book project: http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/generous-thinking-the-university-and-the-public-good/ #generousthinking</p> <p> Wed Feb 28 14:54:11 +0000 2018</p> <p>Replying to @kfitz</p> <p>My argument -- and my sense of what that public good is and how best to serve it -- is of course only one perspective, an inevitably partial one.

I\u2019m curious too what that might look like in the humanities, and without the corporate overlords. #OPReview</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:10:42 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @CMejeur and @humcommons</p> <p>My own experiences with OPR have mostly been CommentPress oriented, including the discussions of Planned Obsolescence and Generous Thinking. But they\u2019ve used a range of definitions for \u201copen,\u201d from open-to-the-world to community-based discussions. #OPReview #A1</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:14:20 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball, @humcommons, @CMejeur and @KairosRTP</p> <p>This sounds very much like something I\u2019ve imagined Humanities Commons working toward: repository as asset manager feeding into journals around the network\u2026 #OPReview #A1</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:16:40 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @CMejeur and @csarven</p> <p>Absolutely! OPR creates the possibility for disrupting what we mean when we talk about peer-reviewed publication. Making things openly available, with transparent review processes, can take lots of forms! #OPReview #A1</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:20:22 +0000 2019</p> <p>Q2: What values would you argue should guide open peer review? How should these values be enacted and communicated? #OPReview #Q2</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:20:32 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball, @PassableGhost, @humcommons and @CMejeur</p> <p>Completely agreed. Many believe that open commenters might be less than candid, but my experience of OPR has been super rigorous \u2014 just constructive! #OPReview</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:21:41 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball</p> <p>I\u2019d second all of that, and would add, per @mkgold\u2019s thread, that caring for that community has to be a top priority. #OPReview #A2 https://twitter.com/mkgold/status/1082811153993158656</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:25:14 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @rachellstarry, @hkpmcgregor, @CMejeur and @humcommons</p> <p>I\u2019m curious about this, too \u2014 OPR is one area in which \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d absolutely Does Not Work. #OPReview #A1</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:31:59 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @CMejeur and @humcommons</p> <p>I like to think that OPR made both of my books much better, not least by giving me so many more different perspectives to think though as I revised them. #OPReview #A3</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:33:23 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @CMejeur and @humcommons</p> <p>OPR also allowed me to see reviewers in dialogue \\(and sometimes disagreement\\) with one another. And it allowed me to give appropriate credit to reviewers for their contributions to my work! #OPReview #A3</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:34:40 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @PassableGhost</p> <p>Yes, absolutely! That sense of scholarly conversation has been central to my interest in OPR. #OPReview #A2</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:38:44 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball</p> <p>Oh, that\u2019s so great! #OPReview #A3</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:40:07 +0000 2019</p> <p>Q4: What are the limitations of open peer review? What are the barriers to more journals and scholarly communities adopting it? #OPReview #Q4</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:40:19 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball and @CMejeur</p> <p>Ha, yes, it\u2019s what we do all the time! We\u2019ve learned how to say politely \\(and with evidence\\) that Reviewer 2 is full of beans. Figuring out what advice to take and what to shelve is part of the process! #OPReview #A3</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:42:55 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @K_Leonard_PhD</p> <p>I\u2019ve run into that as well. I tend to find that folks who were active bloggers in the early days, when we were all arguing \u2014 but all friends \u2014 all the time get it in a way that\u2019s harder for those who weren\u2019t in that milieu. #OPReview #A4</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:44:33 +0000 2019</p> <p>Another barrier I\u2019ve run into is time. Readers have been enormously generous in the time and attention they\u2019ve paid to commenting on my work, but I worry about how scalable that model is. How many manuscripts can get that level of attention? #OPReview #A4</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:45:54 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball</p> <p>Commit to it! This is what OPR is all about! ;-) #OPReview #A4</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:48:29 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @CMejeur</p> <p>Oh my word yes. We need that reorientation quite desperately. But letting go of publishing MORE MORE MORE is going to require a massive rethinking of academic analytics. Maybe a focus for our next chat \\(eh, @HuMetricsHSS\\)? #OPReview #A4</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:50:34 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball and @CMejeur</p> <p>I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d love to see us all get off the treadmill a little bit and focus on real engagement and communication with the work we\u2019re doing, rather than just production for production\u2019s sake, which is where I often feel we are. #OPReview</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:53:07 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @CMejeur and @humcommons</p> <p>This is such a good question, and I feel myself a little stymied by it. Part of what we need to improve OPR is a greater sense of conversation and community among scholars. And the sense that it\u2019s *valued*. #OPReview #A5</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:54:39 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @stevermentz</p> <p>I am *thrilled* to hear this, and will so look forward to hearing more!</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 21:55:30 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball, @CMejeur and @humcommons</p> <p>Ooh, I like this idea!

This was one of the conclusions that the @NEH_ODH #OPReview study we worked on at @MediaCommons came to: OPR can take many forms; the key bit is being transparent about *your* form.</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 22:00:06 +0000 2019</p> <p>Replying to @s2ceball, @K_Leonard_PhD, @allegraswift and @MellonFdn</p> <p>Whoops, it was @MellonFdn! Not really guidelines per se, but meta-guidelines: a whole series of questions that publications needed to answer for themselves and their authors, to be clear and transparent about they values. #OPReview</p> <p> Wed Jan 09 22:02:10 +0000 2019</p> <p>Whew, that was a fast hour.

But there are days when my institution makes it really, really hard.</p> <p> Wed Jun 10 23:46:31 +0000 2020</p> <p>This has been one of those days. https://twitter.com/ReclaimMSU/status/1270779095006228483</p> <p> Wed Jun 10 23:46:52 +0000 2020</p> <p>That is from a university communication that went out yesterday. I have heard from many colleagues who have written to demand an apology. None has reached us yet.</p> <p> Wed Jun 10 23:48:33 +0000 2020</p> <p>And then there\u2019s this. https://twitter.com/GradEmpUnion/status/1270829003130261504</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:19:41 +0000 2020</p> <p>There was a moment not long after I arrived when the degree of brokenness in the culture made itself inescapably clear. Much has been exposed and repair work has begun. But so much remains.</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:23:02 +0000 2020</p> <p>It\u2019s not okay.</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:23:25 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @kate_sonka</p> <p>Way too much.</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:23:51 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @RPR_Agile</p> <p>Thank you so much for this \u2014 I really need it right now.</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:24:29 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @kate_sonka</p> <p>Unfortunately so. I really believe in what the institution ought to be, in what it claims it wants to be. But I am a bit despairing of its real commitment to getting there.</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:31:18 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @atrubek</p> <p>Not a paleographer, but that looks like Maria Zielinski and Anton \\(?\\) Pasternak.</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:39:07 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @atrubek</p> <p>Nope, Zielinska.</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:39:32 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @atrubek and @TerryMetterJr</p> <p>Or Antoni?</p> <p> Thu Jun 11 00:40:41 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @atrubek and @TerryMetterJr</p> <p>Exactly.

Right now getting it out of your inbox before the weekend just dumps it in mine.

This is the cost of not reopening, true. And the cost of reopening campuses where every germ spreads like wildfire will be 1000s of lives. The financial losses you describe are terrible. The human losses I describe are immoral.</p> <p> Fri Aug 07 12:46:58 +0000 2020</p> <p>Replying to @jackcschultz and @marynmck</p> <p>And 2. These financial costs derive from the privatization of higher education and its transformation into a business. Had we not lost the sense of education as a public good, we\u2019d have the state backing required not to have to put dollars over lives.</p> <p> Fri Aug 07 12:48:48 +0000 2020</p> <p>Oh no.

I\u2019m kind of amazed by it.</p> <p> Thu Oct 27 20:41:48 +0000 2022</p> <p>Why does it not surprise me that the business model isn\u2019t in the announcement? https://www.academia.edu/journals/2</p> <p> Thu Oct 27 20:49:27 +0000 2022</p> <p>Replying to @rebeccaonion</p> <p>I never did either! But I recently had some one connect to me there and in adding them something caught my eye. And I\u2019ve found myself going back more often. \\(FYI, the iOS app really is better than the web interface\\.\\)</p> <p> Thu Oct 27 20:51:52 +0000 2022</p> <p>Replying to @KristinMMahoney and @ProfNeilH</p> <p>Congratulations!!!
